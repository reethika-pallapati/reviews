This fragile balance will reshape the future and determine, once and for all, whether human beings are to remain the apex predators on a planet they now share with history's most fearsome creatures in a new Era."

    review: "Love it or hate it, you can't deny one thing- there is something about Twilight that makes it a defining feature of the late 2000s. It presented a fantasy that many found laughable and yet plenty were willing to buy- a wonderful escape for (mainly) girls that there could be a world where someone would come to save them from a mundane, vapid existence- someone exciting, dangerous and attractive who would make them feel special, make their boring lives secretly thrilling.

    review: "2.0 is a remarkable visual extravaganza! Factors like an excellent screenplay, watertight editing, breakneck action and high quality VFX prove why we go to movies. It's a terrific, creative sci-fi actioner. Hats off to Shankar, Akshay, Amy and Rajni sir."

    review: "No doubt. This film is the changing phase for Sandalwood industry. Each and every people have put seeminglessly a hard work and effort. When watching the film, we can cleverly analyze it. KGF: Chapter 1 is not a film. But, it's an epic and must watch for all those, who love high-octane action films."
